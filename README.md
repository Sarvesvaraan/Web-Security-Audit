Features
1. Security Header Analyzer (security_header.py)
This script analyzes the HTTP security headers of a given website and grades it based on the presence and configuration of the following headers:

Strict-Transport-Security: Enforces secure (HTTPS) connections.
Content-Security-Policy: Mitigates the risk of XSS and other code injection attacks.
X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME type sniffing.
X-Frame-Options: Protects against clickjacking.
X-XSS-Protection: Adds an extra layer of protection against XSS attacks.
Referrer-Policy: Controls how much referrer information is included with requests.
Permissions-Policy: Manages permissions for browser features.
2. Web Audit Tool (web-audit.py)
This script performs a series of security tests on a target domain using various security tools. It helps identify vulnerabilities and provides suggestions for remediation.

Vulnerability Classification: Issues are classified as critical, high, medium, low, or informational.
Interactive Scanning: Allows skipping tests or quitting the scan interactively.
Multiple Security Scanners: Utilizes tools like nmap, SSLyze, wafw00f, and more for comprehensive security checks.
Prerequisites
Required Tools
The web-audit.py script relies on several third-party security tools. Ensure these are installed and accessible in your system's PATH:

Nmap: Network exploration tool and security/port scanner.
SSLyze: Fast and comprehensive SSL/TLS configuration analyzer.
wafw00f: Web application firewall detection tool.
Uniscan: A vulnerability scanner and directory checker.
theHarvester: Email, subdomain, and name search tool.
DNSRecon: DNS reconnaissance tool.
dirb: Web content scanner and directory brute-forcing tool.
XSser: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability scanner.
You can install these tools on Ubuntu-based systems using:

sudo apt-get install nmap sslyze wafw00f uniscan theharvester dnsrecon dirb xsser
Python Packages
This project requires the following Python packages:

aiohttp: Asynchronous HTTP client/server framework.
termcolor: Utility for printing colored text to the terminal.
You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
If a requirements.txt file is not available, you can install the packages individually:

pip install aiohttp termcolor
Operating System
This project is best suited for Unix-like operating systems, particularly:

Ubuntu 20.04+: Recommended for its ease of installation of required tools and packages.
Kali Linux: Ideal for penetration testing and security auditing, as it comes pre-installed with many required tools.
While the scripts may work on other operating systems, they are developed and tested primarily on Ubuntu and Kali Linux.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/srinivasan2003/Web-Security-Audit.git
cd Web-Security-Audit
Install the necessary dependencies:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nmap sslyze wafw00f uniscan theharvester dnsrecon dirb xsser
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure that the required tools are in your system's PATH.

Usage
Security Header Analyzer (security_header.py)
This script analyzes the security headers of a single URL or multiple URLs listed in a file.

Analyze a Single URL
python3 security_header.py https://example.com
Analyze Multiple URLs from a File
python3 security_header.py --file urls.txt
The results will be saved to an output file and displayed in the terminal.

Web Audit Tool (web-audit.py)
This script performs a comprehensive security audit of a web domain using a variety of security scanners.

Basic Usage
python3 web-audit.py example.com
Skip Specific Tests
python3 web-audit.py example.com --skip dmitry --skip theHarvester
Disable Spinner/Loader
python3 web-audit.py example.com --nospinner
The tool will display a summary of findings along with recommendations for remediation.
